### Essay : 

#### Introduction

Hook :  In a world where caped superheroes have long captured the children imagination, a new superhoeroe type has been coming. The million-dollar hacker.

Context : This normal person, just using a keyboard and a mouse like all of us, represents a Dark Robin Hood 2.0 in the 21 century. He hack every people he has a problem with, surfing on the Internet wave like a master.

Thesis : However, glorifying such figures as role models for children is a dangerously misguided notion, fraught with ethical quandaries and misleading ideals.

**Why Children Admire Hackers**

1.1 New Generation Outlaws: 

We can start with the fact that children are naturally drawn to figures who break the mold, and hackers, the new generation outlaws, fit this bill perfectly. This was perfectly visible when you consider the likes of the Anonymous, the hacker group that has become a cultural icon, often portrayed as cyber-saviors in the media.

This romanticized image overlooks the inherent illegality and ethical ambiguity in their actions, sending a conflicting message to impressionable minds.

1.2 Intelligence and Power:

Otherwise, the perception of hackers as smart and powerful is another magnetic pull for children. According to the current popular culture, this one is in love with stories of hackers hacking major corporations or government entities, showcasing their technical wizardry, that appears to us like some magic.

This admiration, however, is not over the reality that such skills are often employed in bad and manipulative ways, setting up some sorts of conflicts for young admirers.

**2. The Pitfalls of Admiring Hackers**

2.1 Outlaw Nature:

However, while hackers are often viewed as modern rebels, their outlaw nature is far from admirable. Many of them are engaged in illegal activities like data theft, privacy breaches, and financial fraud. And most of these activities could be against ourselvesâ€¦! Emulating such behavior can lead children down a path where legality and morality become blurred, undermining societal norms.

2.2 Questionable Morality:

This is important. Not all hackers wear white hats. In fact, many are driven by bad intents. Instances of cyberbullying, ransomware attacks, and identity theft often happen and traced back to malicious hackers. These actions are antithetical to the values we wish to instill in our children, such as respect, integrity, and empathy for example.

#### Conclusion

In summation, the figure of the million-dollar hacker, should not be shown as a paradigm for our children.

Their (often-illicit) exploits, though framed as acts of defiance against higher powers, are steeped in ethical complexities and potential harm.

As we said at the start of this essay, hackers are not the only potential superheroes that our children could love and admirate. Think about everyday-heroes for example..
