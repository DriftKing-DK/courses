# Debating in English

## Debate..

Furthermore, a UBI has the potential to address income inequality, a pressing issue in many societies. By providing a basic income to all citizens, we bridge the wealth gap and create a more equitable society. This not only fosters social cohesion but also reduces the strain on public services caused by concentrated poverty.

In conclusion, a well-thought-out Universal Basic Income is not a harbinger of economic ruin but rather a progressive solution to the challenges of the modern world. By adapting to the changing nature of work, stimulating economic activity, and promoting social equality, a UBI can be a key instrument in building a resilient and prosperous nation.

## Debate..

**Introduction & Hook:**
Ladies and gentlemen, imagine being trapped in a body that brings nothing but pain and suffering. 

This is the grim reality for many terminally ill patients. 

Today, I stand before you to discuss a topic that is not just about medical ethics, but about human compassion - euthanasia.

**Context and View:**
Euthanasia is about ending a life to relieve pain and suffering. It has been a topic of moral and ethical debate for decades. 

I firmly believe that euthanasia is a humane and dignified way for terminally ill patients to end their suffering, under strict legal regulation.

**Counter Argument 1:**
Some argue that euthanasia could lead to the devaluation of human life. However, with some applied laws and ethical guidelines, we can ensure that euthanasia is a safe, controlled, and compassionate choice, available only to those who truly need it.

**Counter Argument 2:**
Secondly, euthanasia can be seen as an act of compassion. We show mercy and compassion for animals in pain by euthanizing them; why then do we deny the same compassion to our fellow humans? 

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, euthanasia, when regulated carefully, is not about giving up on life, but about ending a life that is already lost to suffering. It is about dignity, choice, and compassion. 

I urge you to consider the immense relief it can bring to those in the most desperate of situations. Thank you.

# Conviction Speech

Laws are able to keep up with advancements in technology ?

## Introduction

- Describing technologies in the current world, and say something about the incredible evolution speed. Take an example in the 70s, 50 ys ago, for watching content and what's used now.
- Positionning myself
- Hook: imagine that our current world only has flying cars, but the laws have been made 50 years ago for usual-on-floor cars. What a mess it could be ?!

## Arguments

### Laws and security

- Laws are here to protect people about each other
- When the legislation is not adapted to the current world, some issues can be seen
- Example: Ransomware (joke about solution for crypting your data) 'WannaCry' in 2017, 200 000 computers in 150 countries. This shows the huge gap between the legislation and the things that can be done in a cyberattack

### Innovation and regulation

- Continue innovation, but the regulation is not always adapted
- Example: The drones are used for a lot of actions, from spying your neightboors to delivery some packages from Amazon. But, without some regulations laws, this could lead to lots of concerns about life privacy, at least. That's why, in 2016, The Federak Aviation Adminitration set up multiple laws about drones usage.

### Data privacy (yes, again)

- In 40 years, internet has become something used by every people over the hearth, every day. With this grows, some issues have been reached, on data privacy for example.
- So, in 2018, the European Union has adotped a regulation made for protect people on the Internet, in french the RGPD. This regulation force companies to be more transparent about what they do with the data that we give to them.

## Conclusion

- Resume previous arguments
- Say why the laws **have to** be able to keep up with new technologies, and say that we have seen why it's so difficult.
