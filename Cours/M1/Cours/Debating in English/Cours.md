Furthermore, a UBI has the potential to address income inequality, a pressing issue in many societies. By providing a basic income to all citizens, we bridge the wealth gap and create a more equitable society. This not only fosters social cohesion but also reduces the strain on public services caused by concentrated poverty.

In conclusion, a well-thought-out Universal Basic Income is not a harbinger of economic ruin but rather a progressive solution to the challenges of the modern world. By adapting to the changing nature of work, stimulating economic activity, and promoting social equality, a UBI can be a key instrument in building a resilient and prosperous nation.

**Introduction & Hook:**
Ladies and gentlemen, imagine being trapped in a body that brings nothing but pain and suffering. 

This is the grim reality for many terminally ill patients. 

Today, I stand before you to discuss a topic that is not just about medical ethics, but about human compassion - euthanasia.

**Context and View:**
Euthanasia is about ending a life to relieve pain and suffering. It has been a topic of moral and ethical debate for decades. 

I firmly believe that euthanasia is a humane and dignified way for terminally ill patients to end their suffering, under strict legal regulation.

**Counter Argument 1:**
Some argue that euthanasia could lead to the devaluation of human life. However, with some applied laws and ethical guidelines, we can ensure that euthanasia is a safe, controlled, and compassionate choice, available only to those who truly need it.

**Counter Argument 2:**
Secondly, euthanasia can be seen as an act of compassion. We show mercy and compassion for animals in pain by euthanizing them; why then do we deny the same compassion to our fellow humans? 

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, euthanasia, when regulated carefully, is not about giving up on life, but about ending a life that is already lost to suffering. It is about dignity, choice, and compassion. 

I urge you to consider the immense relief it can bring to those in the most desperate of situations. Thank you.
